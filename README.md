### What I learned

This challenge gave me practice with reproducing a professional layout using everything I've learned up until this point. I also learned several new things in the process, including semantic HTML, transitions on button hovers, :before and :after psuedo elements, forms, and implementing custom background images. I also worked with several new units such as rem, em, and vw to make the page more responsive. Additionally, I learned how to make my code more readable by using custom variables, dividing it into sections, and adding comments when necessary.

### Continued development

I am now confident enough in my CSS skills to begin learning basic JavaScript.
